Simple osm routing engine.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6.1 or newer

## Installation

```sh
pip install routor
```

## Usage

### CLI

Use the integrated cli to calculate a route.

```text
$ python -m routor --help
Usage: python -m routor [OPTIONS] MAP ORIGIN DESTINATION [travel_time|length]

  Calculate a shortest path.

  MAP Path to an OSM file. Format: .osm.xml
  ORIGIN GPS location. Format: latitude,longitude
  DESTINATION GPS location. Format: latitude,longitude

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### Web API

#### Configuration

The configuration is either read from a `.env` file or the environment.
Before you are able to run the server, you have to set the variables mentioned in [routor/api/config.py](routor/api/config.py).

#### Run the API

The api is served using [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).
To start the server run

```sh
uvicorn routor.api:app
```

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

#### Register a new weight function

Existing weight functions are defined in [routor/weights.py](routor/weights.py).
To add a new weight functon, you have to create a new project and add `routor` as dependency.
Create a new file, eg. `main.py` and add the following content, which will become the entrypoint for `uvicorn`.

```python
# main.py
from typing import Optional

from routor.api.main import app  # noqa
from routor.weights import register
from routor import models


def my_weight_func(prev_edge: Optional[models.Edge], edge: models.Edge) -> float:
    ...
    return ...


register(my_weight_func, "weight_func")
```

Start the server with `uvicorn main:app` and the weight function will be available as `weight_func` when calling the api.

## Development

This project uses [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) for packaging and
managing all dependencies and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run
[flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/),
[mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and [black](https://github.com/python/black).

Clone this repository and run

```bash
poetry install
poetry run pre-commit install
```

to create a virtual enviroment containing all dependencies.
Afterwards, You can run the test suite using

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

This repository follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
style.

### Cookiecutter template

This project was created using [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) and the
[cookiecutter-pyproject](https://github.com/escaped/cookiecutter-pypackage) template.
In order to update this repository to the latest template version run

```sh
cruft update
